		<h1>Hecks</h1>
		<p>
		Hecks is an original strategy board game for two players, invented by Maayan Blum, who also created this site.
		The rules of the game are extremely simple and can be learned in a few minutes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFBQmppjVC4
		" class="mainLink">here</a>.</p>

		If you like the game, or you like me (not likely), I would very much appreciate if you shared this post or the links to the site/tutorial either on facebook or on any relevant group/forum where you think people might be interested in it. This way we can enjoy a wider player-base and a bigger community!

		<h3>Features</h3>
		<p>
		Currently the site has multi chat rooms, you can create your own chat room and invite your friends. private chats are also possible, click on someone's name and choose the chat option. you can invite someone for a game the same way, or you can also be paired for a game using the automatch system (press play in the upper panel).
		The site is working from all devices, if you play from a smart phone you will have a first-click zoom-in feature to make it easy to place moves.
		*The site is currently in a very early stage, alot of features are yet to come in the future such as review mode, more colors for players, etc.</p>

		<h1>Hecks</h1>
		<p>
		Hecks is an original strategy board game for two players, invented by Maayan Blum, who also created this site.
		The rules of the game are extremely simple and can be learned in a few minutes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwcFgKtBeTw&list=PLWGBYB0qplePwydT_Suc61LcwI93ndiw_&index=1
		" class="mainLink" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<h3>Features</h3>
		<p>
		Currently the site has multi chat rooms, you can create your own chat room and invite your friends. private chats are also possible, click on someone's name and choose the chat option. you can invite someone for a game the same way, or you can also be paired for a game using the automatch system (press play in the upper panel).
		The site is working from all devices, if you play from a smart phone you will have a first-click zoom-in feature to make it easy to place moves. Newest features include a basic review mode for post game analysis, a fully functioning bot for you to play against, a game list in each player's and also a top 100 ranked players list.
